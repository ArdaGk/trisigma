Things to watch out for
negative balance position error --> compare the bal/pos with the real binance
access to pear balances maybe???
shrinking the trades to as specific time frame might cause this error, the cutting line has to be when the position was zero

Globals symbol data must be under variables key

Binance use all orders as open orders and merge the open_orders and trades stast. Update the data from the general orders.

stats_read
    I: orders, stats(orderIds)
    O: open_orders, trades, balances

    Fields:
        orderId (primary)
        side
        qty
        type
        status

stats_write
    append the order id on every trade

update_cut

update_trades for pos storage

add them in buy/sell

__save (order)
    check if its valid ("time")
    save to [label]_stats.json's open orders
