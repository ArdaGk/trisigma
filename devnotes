Things to watch out for
negative balance position error --> compare the bal/pos with the real binance
access to pear balances maybe???
shrinking the trades to as specific time frame might cause this error, the cutting line has to be when the position was zero

Binance use all orders as open orders and merge the open_orders and trades stast. Update the data from the general orders.

Balance problem:
    too much orders might interrupt the framework. Cutting from certain dates might make the balance inaccurate
    Solution 1:
        Zero date: store the nearest date where the position was zero. Client has to access zero date of all the tickers, or it should set it itself
    Solution 2:
        Store the balance at an interval like week, use this data to calculate the new balance


order_mathing:
    I: orders, stats(orderIds)
    O: open_orders, trades, balances

    Fields:
        orderId (primary)
        side
        qty
        type
        status

write:
    append the order id on every trade

add them in buy/sell

__save (order)
    check if its valid ("time")
    save to [label]_stats.json's open orders
